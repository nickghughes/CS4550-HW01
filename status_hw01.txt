5. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
Creating a valid route to serve images within the site. After
realizing that the images are served the same way as webpages,
I was able to figure it out. However, I still feel unsure about
what the best practice for static images is between the following
options:
- Place them inside ~www/hw01.grumdog.com/images
- Create a new top-level directory ~images with a different location
  block in the configuration file, that way images are available for
  all deployed sites.
